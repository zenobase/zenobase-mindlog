Zenobase MindLog
================

Zenobase MindLog is a simple Android app for recording meditation sessions with a 
[NeuroSky MindWave](http://www.neurosky.com/Products/MindWave.aspx) headset. 

This app can be used as a template for apps that record data to [Zenobase](https://zenobase.com/) through the 
[API](https://zenobase.com/#/api/); in particular, this app demonstrates how to use OAuth2 to obtain an authorization 
and send data to Zenobase on behalf of a user.

When Bluetooth is disabled, the app will simulate a headset with random data.
